## Search Engine Optimisation
#### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating SEO for Zitmall
- Introduction
In this guide, I will explain the step-by-step process followed to create an SEO-friendly homepage for Zitmall, an online marketplace specializing in electronics and kitchen products in Nigeria. I will cover the implementation of long-tail and short-tail keywords, meta descriptions, and other SEO elements to enhance the website's visibility and ranking on search engines.

#### Step 1: Identify Relevant Keywords
First, I identified relevant long-tail and short-tail keywords that potential customers might use when searching for products offered by Zitmall. 
[Google](https://google.com) search and [Ryrob](https://www.ryrob.com/keyword-tool/) free research tool were used to determine popular keywords while [Neil Patel Ubbersuggests](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) app was used to choose the ones with high clicks but lower competition. The best keywords were observed to be short, (eg Television, electronics, appliances) high in competition and very often, were vague and directed users to sites that were not necessarily e-commerce sites

- #### Google search auto-generated keyword ![Google search auto-generated keyword](documentation/google-auto-search-home-seo.png)
- #### Google search related keywords ![Google search related keywords](documentation/google-search-keyword-suggestions.png)
- #### Ryrob Keyword ideas ![Ryrob Keyword ideas](documentation/ryrob-keyword-suggestions.png)

- #### Ubbersuggest accepted keywords ![Ubbersuggest accepted keywords](documentation/ubersuggests-keyword-ideas-2.png)
- #### Ubbersuggest other industry competitors ![Ubbersuggest other industry competitors](documentation/ubersuggest-screen-seo.png)


The keywords were categorized to cover various aspects of the business:

- Long-tail Keywords:
Buy electronics online in Nigeria
Online marketplace for electronics and kitchen
Best online shopping site for home appliances
Cheap smartphones and tablets online
Discounted laptops and computers for sale
Buy home entertainment systems online
Best deals on smart home devices
Top-rated online store for cameras and accessories
- Short-tail Keywords:
Online shopping
Electronics
Home appliances
Smartphones
Laptops
Kitchen appliances
Smart home devices
#### Step 2: Craft the Homepage Content
Using the identified keywords, I crafted a comprehensive and engaging homepage content for Zitmall. The content was designed to be informative, promotional, and keyword-rich to attract both search engines and users. Below is the content created:

## Testing & Formatting
Rigorous manual testing was performed to ensure the app's functionality, including user inputs, menu navigation, and responsiveness across screens.

### JSHint
All JavaScript files have been formatted using [jShint](https://jshint.com/) where notable errors about lines not ending properly with a semicolon. All the issues were promptly addressed. However, there were warnings regarding:
 -1- 	'template literal syntax' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6'). especially on the stripe.js file. These warnings were ignored as they did not pose a threat to our code
 -2- ["Undefined variables"](documentation/jshint-undefined-variables) These were variables that were not present in the same file but were already referenced in the corresponding HTML django template files. I therefore ignored these warnings as there was nothing wrong with the concept of having the variables in the host HTML files.


### Google PageSpeed Insights:
[PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) was used to check for the Speed, performance, SEO, and Accessibility of the pages. 
Google PageSpeed insights was used to test the speed of the website and various issues were highlighted which was followed by subsequent adjustments.
A notable issue raised was about having too many scripts being loaded before the first image and test were loaded. I fixed that by making sure that javascript files are taken to the bottom of the page. I also reduced the size of my hero image and converted it to Webp format.

- [Vendor Signup page](documentation/pg-vendor-signup-desktop.png)
- [Vendor signup page mobile](documentation/pg-vendor-signup-mobile.png)


### W3 Validator:
[W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to check for errors on the HTML pages. All highlighted errors were eliminated by correcting the codes, removing extra tags where necessary, adding aria attributes where missing, adding "href" or button as a role where necessary and generally following standard naming conventions/practice. 
- [Home page validator screenshot](documentation/w3-validator-index-page)

The W3 validator was used to check errors and all found errors were correct. There were however warnings concerning text with the "article" elements on the devotional pages and programmes page. The warning advised on the use of headings (h2-h6) to write the articles.

### CI Python Linter:
All Python file was fully formatted with [Pep8Ci](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and all errors have been corrected, with the main errors being lines extending over 79 characters. However, there we errors regarding long lines exceeding 79 characters on the [settings file](documentation/settings-pep8-error) which were ignored. I ignored them because they were system files, many of which were auto-generated. They do not pose a threat to the workings of our code.

### Browser Testing:
The final project was tested on four different browsers, namely:
-Microsoft Internet explorer
-Google Chrome
-Brave
-Mozilla
The output was similar on all these browsers except on firefox, where the fonts appeared darker and were therefore better viewed in terms of clarity and contrast.

## Zitmall Business Model Summary
Zitmall operates as a comprehensive online marketplace specializing in electronics and kitchen products. The platform employs a dual business model, functioning both as a direct retailer and a marketplace for third-party vendors.

- Direct Sales: Zitmall sources and sells a wide range of electronics and kitchen products directly to consumers. This allows Zitmall to control product quality, pricing, and inventory, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

- Marketplace for Vendors: In addition to its inventory, Zitmall provides a platform for external vendors to list and sell their products. This expands the product variety available to consumers and allows vendors to reach a larger audience.

- Commission-Based Revenue: For every successful sale made by third-party vendors, Zitmall collects a commission ranging from 5% to 10%. This commission-based model incentivizes vendors to maintain high sales volumes while generating steady revenue for Zitmall.

- Marketing: The main marketing channel is Google Ads, which attracts more intent-driven customers. Additionally, Zitmall plans to leverage Facebook for its cost-effectiveness, along with email subscriptions and newsletters, Instagram videos, WhatsApp status updates, and articles/blogging to reach a wider audience and engage customers.

Through this hybrid model, Zitmall aims to offer a diverse product selection, competitive prices, and a reliable shopping experience, while fostering a thriving ecosystem for vendors.

## Future Development and Limitations
- Work on a feature that does the commission calculations and thus helps vendors see how much goes to Zit and what's left.
- Work on a feature that helps vendors see how much has been made on the platform
- The search bar seldom did not return the expected query when full product titles were inputted. A more sophisticated query search would be created and added.
